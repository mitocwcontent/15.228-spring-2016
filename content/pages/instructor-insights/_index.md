_Below, Natalie Pitcher, a member of the Study Tour student organizing team and the Curriculum Coordinator, shares her insights about facilitating 15.228: MBA Study Tour: Innovation Islands – How New Zealand Became A Global Player in the Race to Innovate._

### Key Learning

The New Zealand Study Tour focused on MIT's [Regional Entrepreneurship Acceleration Program (REAP)](http://reap.mit.edu/) framework, which is grounded in the need for collaboration amongst five stakeholders within the entrepreneurial ecosystem. Given this lens, as I traveled throughout New Zealand I gained respect for the real world difficulty in producing real change within an ecosystem, given the number of people who must be aligned to truly accelerate change.

### Advice for Other Students

To get the most out of a Study Tour, ensure that your fellow Study Tour participants are active leaders within the group, working in partnership with the student organizing team. Empowering fellow students to make the most of the trip created a truly collaborative action learning experience that the team never could have created in a top-down manner.

### Advice for Study Tour Organizers

To create a rigorous and relevant Study Tour, develop a strong theme to closely tie the class structure to the company visits and experience in country. The theme will allow the students to develop a clear base in the subject, and will even ensure the companies you collaborate with to present relevant material to your student group. If you do not guide the companies, you risk wasting both their time and the time of your group. The New Zealand Study Tour was extremely successful in this regard, which allowed for a superior learning experience for our students and excellent momentum during our two-week trip.
